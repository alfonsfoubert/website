Hello everybody!

Today I want to share with you a small portion of a training I made for a company about helping people change habits.

During this workshop I helped a class change their habits. It had 2 parts the theory (you'll see the link at the end of the post) and the practical part which will remain confidential in favor of the students.

### Key Ideas

#### It’s not a capacity issue but a motivational one.

We think we can’t make a new habit, like going to the gym, or stop doing one like over-eating, but the truth is that it’s not a capacity problem. When we say I can’t it’s actually bullshit it’s a motivational issue, that’s where your focus has to be.

How do you manage your own motivation so that you don’t fall for the easy path.

#### Be aware of the cost of inaction

Make sure you’re constantly aware of what’s really costing you for the long term not calling that person, smoking, etc … it will help you when motivation goes down, which it will inevitably will.

#### Engineer your environment for your success

Whatever it is you want to change, and knowing your strengths and weaknesses use them in your favor.

You want to eat more healthy, have a fruit bowl on the main table so that it’s easy for you to grab an apple.

Do you want to stop watching too many videos? Set a maximum timer that goes off when you pass your desired time.

#### Extra Tip

Use social pressure to your advantage

Make bets, commitments, go public with what you want to achieve. By doing so you’ll have extra pressure that will increase the odds that you succeed on changing the behaviour you want.
