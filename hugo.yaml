      I know how it feels

      I remember the exact moment I got promoted and thought: "Now what?"

      I've been leading technical teams for over 15 years and training leaders for 7. I've made every mistake in the book and learned how to fix them. Now I help engineering managers and tech leads find clarity when everything feels overwhelming.

      I won't give you theory. I'll help you solve what's on your plate right now: the conflict with that senior engineer, the team that's underperforming, the expectations you don't know how to manage.

      Because leadership isn't about having all the answers. It's about knowing what to do with the questions.
